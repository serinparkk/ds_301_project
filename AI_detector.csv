"hey, can i give some indirectly related advice? once you find a phd program, keep an eye on job listings starting way before youre on the market. think about how to present your work in ways that will be exciting to hiring committees and undergrads--not necessarily changing the meat of the work, but how you frame it to make it relevant to current interests. make sure you take teaching opportunities that let you present your work in the contexts of currently desirable courses. give people lots and lots of chances to understand why they should be excited to hire/take a class from someone who works on american gothic lit.

"if someone with a bad heart condition or high blood pressure were to hear bad news today in an advanced and wealthy society then the medications they were already taking or could take in an emergency or the medical services available to them would likely prevent fatality. in societies where diagnosis was imperfect, medications less efficacious and top quality health care primitive by comparison with the highest currently available then a sudden shock could produce a heart attack or stroke (apoplexy) which being untreatable would result in death.in pre-electrification societies household chores were very tough indeed. there is an episode of *the thing about austen* podcast that looks into the subject of laundry in the regency period, if you listen to it it may answer some of your questions [the thing about mariannes washing](

"we covered tess in my class some years ago and just want to add the element of religion to your list. i don’t remember much, but off the top of my head, how tess was embodied pagan innocence — angel described her as a “child of nature” or something similar. along a similar thread, there is the also the element of tess as a sacrificial victim, which is both associated with paganism and christianity. of course, there is the poignant ending of tess awaiting persecution as she lies down at stonehenge which was, in hardy’s time, considered a temple of sorts. that’s all i can remember but do include religion in your discussion. if you must refer back to the author, iirc, hardy struggled with his family’s christian beliefs.

"you already got a nice compilation of texts from the mod, i would nontheless like to add a description of our work because your question shows a crucial missunderstanding of how the craft of history - as a social science - works.first, lets imagine you were a police officer. you got to solve a murder case. what do you do?you look for evidence. you dont just ask the neighbour ""did you kill james?""; that would be kinda silly in itself. you try to get multiple people to tell you what they saw or heard, and crossreference them. in your mind, you always know that they might lie or, more probable, just be wrong - eyewitnesses are wrong all the time. thats why you also use material evidence: you consult ballistics specialists to find the most probable trajectory of the bullet, and so on.as you might guess from this setup, a historian does work in a comparable way. historians never blindly trust their sources (or at least, they shouldnt...). instead, they ask themselves (exspecially for ""younger"" history) what kind of evidence a certain event might have produced. a big battle with thousend of dead people would produce - well, dead people. those would be registred by the church, maybe even get a thombstone with their date of death engraved. if a person moves from europe to the us in the 19th century, what kind of evidence does he produce?we get letters back home to his family; we get an application for a passport; we get an auction where they sell off their stuff (as they cant transport all of it); we might get a plea for monetary aid to the community to afford the ocean crossing; we get shipping papers, who where often sent back to their hometowns to prove that transportation had indeed be sucessfull. even tough any single account could be a forgery, or could be missing, or could just be people making a mistake - the total gives a very solid picture of who emigrated and what their socio-ecomnomic status was.and ofc, historians often rely on specialists, too. for example, there is a famous quote by vegetius claiming that the roman army trained with shields made of wicker, twice as heavy as a real one. however, experimental archeologists have found this to be impossible. wicker is really, really light. even if you make the shield absurdly thick, its still light. so vegetius was either lying, plain wrong or - the most probable one - meant something different, e.g. wicker filled with something. we dont just trust him blindly, we check if what he says is actually physicially possible.your misssunderstanding seems to be that historians merely collect accounts and publish them. but thats not the case. historiography is the complex task of evaluating sources, evaluating their meaning, crossreferencing them, and so on. we dont want to rely on opinions people who died centuries ago; thats why written accounts of an event are usually among the less desirable sources. what historians really want is your shopping list, not your political speeches: they allow for a much deeper insight in what live is like.",History,Human,Human,Human,Human,

"it’s often difficult in a field as broad as philosophy to get a sense of what the general consensus is surrounding an idea or figure. broadly, bostrom is respected as a philosopher and his ideas are considered reasonable. i read his work in both an undergraduate class about ai and one about philosophy of mind. he is influential even within philosophy, in that there has been a bunch of scholarship written in response to his work, either building on it or critiquing it.the vast majority of philosophers do not believe that we are living in a simulation. even if they think he gives good (or at least valid) reasons, they think the reasons for thinking otherwise (such as the lack of empirical evidence and the intuitive implausibility) weigh heavier. regarding longtermism, it is similarly respected (mostly) but unpopular. this is largely (i think) because it relies on a particularly strong theory of consequentialism which most philosophers reject. in the most recent survey of philosophers done by philpapers.org, only about 1/3 of respondents identified as consequentialists. the other 2/3 were mostly deontologists or virtue theorists. those are the three primary schools of ethics in the history of philosophy. outside of oxford, consequentialism has become less and less popular among philosophers over the last 50-60 years. even if a philosopher is a consequentialist, there are many ways to be a consequentialist without adopting longtermism.that is the academic answer. beyond that, and although i only have a mere undergraduate degree, i have noticed what i think is a skepticism (or, more favorably to bostrom, jealousy) of bostrom’s brand of celebrity philosophy among many professional philosophers. longtermism is a very niche, minority view - there’s no problem with that, many respected views are minority. however, it has garnered an outsized popular following among certain billionaires, silicon valley elites, and “tech-bros” that, given its limited appeal to philosophers, seems undeserved. to more radical critics, these tech elites are grabbing onto longtermism and effective altruism because these ideas allow them to view themselves as “saviors of humanity,” not just because they are “building the best future” with their technology, but also because they can justify their vast wealth by donating some of it to what they view as “the most effective” causes. this amounts to a heroizing of the wealthiest and most privileged members of society who would otherwise be criticized for hoarding wealth and committing unethical business practices. to be clear, bostrom and other effective altruists don’t endorse this, but they don’t seem eager to criticize it either, especially when such elites are heaping praise on them. there seems to be a lack of humility going on that is atypical of philosophers.
